    "#### 1.1.2 Parameter Explanation\n",
    "We specify the hyperparameters for the Azure OpenAI models within the helper functions. Users can tune the parameters according to different needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###### **Temperature**\n",
    "Temperature ranges from 0 to 2.\n",
    "Here is a quick breakdown of how it works:\n",
    "- Low temperature (0 to 0.3): More focused, coherent, and conservative outputs.\n",
    "- Medium temperature (0.3 to 0.7): Balanced creativity and coherence.\n",
    "- High temperature (> 0.7): Highly creative and diverse, but potentially less coherent.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### **Top_p**\n",
    "Sets the probability mass cutoff for token sampling, affecting the breadth of options the AI considers. \n",
    "Higher values lead to more randomness, while lower values result in more focused outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The “top_p” parameter is like a filter that controls how many different words or phrases the language model considers when it’s trying to predict the next word. If you set the “top p” value to 0.5, the language model will only consider the 50 most likely words or phrases that might come next. But if you set the “top p” value to 0.9, the language model will consider the 90 most likely words or phrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "And as \"top_p\" and \"temperature\" performs similar job as hyperparameter, we usually only tune one of them instead of both.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### **Max_tokens**\n",
    "Max_tokens determine the maximum length of the generated text. By setting a limit, you can control how much text the LLM model will return, making sure it doesn't give too long of an answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### **Frequency_penalty**\n",
    "Frequency_penalty makes sure that the text that is generated is varied by giving a penalty to tokens that have already been used in the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "It ranges from -2.0 to 2.0, with higher values resulting in more diverse output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim."

      ".NET provides several features and tools that facilitate the integration of AI into applications. Here are some key aspects:\n",

      "1. **ML.NET**: This is a cross-platform, open-source machine learning framework for .NET developers. It allows you to build custom machine learning models using C# or F#. ML.NET supports various tasks like classification, regression, clustering, anomaly detection, and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Integration with Azure Cognitive Services**: .NET can easily integrate with Azure Cognitive Services to add pre-built AI capabilities such as vision recognition (e.g., image tagging), speech processing (e.g., text-to-speech), language understanding (e.g., sentiment analysis), and decision-making APIs.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **ONNX Runtime Support**: The Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) format is supported in .NET through the ONNX Runtime library which allows developers to run pre-trained deep learning models across different platforms efficiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **TensorFlow.NET & SciSharp Stack**: For those who prefer working directly with TensorFlow within a .NET environment or need more control over their neural network architectures beyond what ML.NET offers out-of-the-box solutions for integrating TensorFlow models via bindings provided by libraries like TensorFlow.NET exist alongside other scientific computing resources from SciSharp stack ecosystem including NumSharp etcetera making it easier than ever before!\n",
      "\n",
      "5..Net Interactive Notebooks - Jupyter notebooks have become popular among data scientists due largely because they allow interactive exploration visualization sharing insights quickly without needing setup complex environments first! With support now available natively inside Visual Studio Code IDE thanks recent updates made possible through collaboration between Microsoft community members alike anyone interested exploring these possibilities should definitely check them out today if haven’t already done so yet themselves firsthand experience how powerful this toolset truly can be when combined together seamlessly under single roof right fingertips ready go whenever wherever needed most urgently next time around too perhaps?\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall,. NET's robust ecosystem makes it an excellent choice for integrating artificial intelligence into your projects whether you're building web apps desktop software cloud-based services anything else imaginable really given flexibility scalability offered here unmatched anywhere else industry currently stands today!\n"

Tokyo was selected as the host city during the 125th IOC Session in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 7 September 2013.Originally scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August 2020, the event was postponed to 2021 on 24 March 2020 due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, the first such instance in the history of the Olympic Games (previous games had been cancelled but not rescheduled). However, the event retained the Tokyo 2020 branding for marketing purposes. It was largely held behind closed doors with no public spectators permitted due to the declaration of a state of emergency in the Greater Tokyo Area in response to the pandemic, the first and only Olympic Games to be held without official spectators. The Games were the most expensive ever, with total spending of over $20 billion.The Games were the fourth Olympic Games to be held in Japan, following the 1964 Summer Olympics (Tokyo), 1972 Winter Olympics (Sapporo), and 1998 Winter Olympics (Nagano). Tokyo became the first city in Asia to hold the Summer Olympic Games twice. The 2020 Games were the second of three consecutive Olympics to be held in East Asia, following the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea and preceding the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, China. Due to the one-year postponement, Tokyo 2020 was the first and only Olympic Games to have been held in an odd-numbered year and the first Summer Olympics since 1900 to be held in a non-leap year.\\nNew events were introduced in existing sports, including 3x3 basketball, freestyle BMX and mixed gender team events in a number of existing sports, as well as the return of madison cycling for men and an introduction of the same event for women. New IOC policies also allowed the host organizing committee to add new sports to the Olympic program for just one Games. The disciplines added by the Japanese Olympic Committee were baseball and softball, karate, sport climbing, surfing and skateboarding, the last four of which made their Olympic debuts, and the last three of which will remain on the Olympic program.The United States topped the medal count by both total golds (39) and total medals (113), with China finishing second by both respects (38 and 89). Host nation Japan finished third, setting a record for the most gold medals and total medals ever won by their delegation at an Olympic Games with 27 and 58. Great Britain finished fourth, with a total of 22 gold and 64 medals.

    "    The 2020 Summer Olympics, officially the Games of the XXXII Olympiad and also known as Tokyo 2020, was an international multi-sport event held from 23 July to 8 August 2021 in Tokyo, Japan, with some preliminary events that began on 21 July 2021. Tokyo was selected as the host city during the 125th IOC Session in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 7 September 2013.Originally scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August 2020, the event was postponed to 2021 on 24 March 2020 due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, the first such instance in the history of the Olympic Games (previous games had been cancelled but not rescheduled). However, the event retained the Tokyo 2020 branding for marketing purposes. It was largely held behind closed doors with no public spectators permitted due to the declaration of a state of emergency in the Greater Tokyo Area in response to the pandemic, the first and only Olympic Games to be held without official spectators. The Games were the most expensive ever, with total spending of over $20 billion.The Games were the fourth Olympic Games to be held in Japan, following the 1964 Summer Olympics (Tokyo), 1972 Winter Olympics (Sapporo), and 1998 Winter Olympics (Nagano). Tokyo became the first city in Asia to hold the Summer Olympic Games twice. The 2020 Games were the second of three consecutive Olympics to be held in East Asia, following the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea and preceding the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, China. Due to the one-year postponement, Tokyo 2020 was the first and only Olympic Games to have been held in an odd-numbered year and the first Summer Olympics since 1900 to be held in a non-leap year.\\nNew events were introduced in existing sports, including 3x3 basketball, freestyle BMX and mixed gender team events in a number of existing sports, as well as the return of madison cycling for men and an introduction of the same event for women. New IOC policies also allowed the host organizing committee to add new sports to the Olympic program for just one Games. The disciplines added by the Japanese Olympic Committee were baseball and softball, karate, sport climbing, surfing and skateboarding, the last four of which made their Olympic debuts, and the last three of which will remain on the Olympic program.The United States topped the medal count by both total golds (39) and total medals (113), with China finishing second by both respects (38 and 89). Host nation Japan finished third, setting a record for the most gold medals and total medals ever won by their delegation at an Olympic Games with 27 and 58. Great Britain finished fourth, with a total of 22 gold and 64 medals. The Russian delegation competing as the ROC finished fifth with 20 gold medals and third in the overall medal count, with 71 medals. Bermuda, the Philippines and Qatar won their first-ever Olympic gold medals. Burkina Faso, San Marino and Turkmenistan also won their first-ever Olympic medals.'\n",

    "    The 2020 Summer Olympics, officially the Games of the XXXII Olympiad and also known as Tokyo 2020, was an international multi-sport event held from 23 July to 8 August 2021 in Tokyo, Japan, with some preliminary events that began on 21 July 2021. Tokyo was selected as the host city during the 125th IOC Session in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 7 September 2013.Originally scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August 2020, the event was postponed to 2021 on 24 March 2020 due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, the first such instance in the history of the Olympic Games (previous games had been cancelled but not rescheduled). However, the event retained the Tokyo 2020 branding for marketing purposes. It was largely held behind closed doors with no public spectators permitted due to the declaration of a state of emergency in the Greater Tokyo Area in response to the pandemic, the first and only Olympic Games to be held without official spectators. The Games were the most expensive ever, with total spending of over $20 billion.The Games were the fourth Olympic Games to be held in Japan, following the 1964 Summer Olympics (Tokyo), 1972 Winter Olympics (Sapporo), and 1998 Winter Olympics (Nagano). Tokyo became the first city in Asia to hold the Summer Olympic Games twice. The 2020 Games were the second of three consecutive Olympics to be held in East Asia, following the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea and preceding the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, China. Due to the one-year postponement, Tokyo 2020 was the first and only Olympic Games to have been held in an odd-numbered year and the first Summer Olympics since 1900 to be held in a non-leap year.\\nNew events were introduced in existing sports, including 3x3 basketball, freestyle BMX and mixed gender team events in a number of existing sports, as well as the return of madison cycling for men and an introduction of the same event for women. New IOC policies also allowed the host organizing committee to add new sports to the Olympic program for just one Games. The disciplines added by the Japanese Olympic Committee were baseball and softball, karate, sport climbing, surfing and skateboarding, the last four of which made their Olympic debuts, and the last three of which will remain on the Olympic program.The United States topped the medal count by both total golds (39) and total medals (113), with China finishing second by both respects (38 and 89). Host nation Japan finished third, setting a record for the most gold medals and total medals ever won by their delegation at an Olympic Games with 27 and 58. Great Britain finished fourth, with a total of 22 gold and 64 medals. The Russian delegation competing as the ROC finished fifth with 20 gold medals and third in the overall medal count, with 71 medals. Bermuda, the Philippines and Qatar won their first-ever Olympic gold medals. Burkina Faso, San Marino and Turkmenistan also won their first-ever Olympic medals.'\n",
